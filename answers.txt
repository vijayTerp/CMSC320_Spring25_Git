Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git allows programmers to collaborate with each 
other while working on different components of a project 
simultaneously without conflict. It can also allow us to 
change to prior versions of code if required.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an 
Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the field of 
linguistics. This could be used to compare the features 
of different languages in a tabular manner, tracking the 
morphemes and syntax structure frequencies in different 
sampled speakers of each language.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging takes two branches and combines them, 
while rebasing takes the commits from one branch and 
moves them on top of another. Thus, merging preserves 
all of the previous commits in each of the combined 
branches, while rebasing creates a clearner line of 
commits.
